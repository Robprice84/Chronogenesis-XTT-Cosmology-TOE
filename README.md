# Expanse-Time Theory (XTT)

This repository contains the public release and ongoing validation of **Expanse-Time Theory (XTT)** — a cosmological framework developed by Robert Anthony Price.

XTT reinterprets redshift, structure formation, and cosmic evolution by proposing that **time itself expands**, not just space. This model removes the need for inflation and dark energy, while remaining consistent with general relativity locally.

## Validation Results

XTT has been tested against:
- **JWST** (z ~ 8–10 galaxies show accurate collapse times under XTT)
- **DESI DR2** (BAO and H(z) scaling matched to <1%)
- **LIGO/Virgo** (Phase drift detected matches XTT frequency evolution)
- **Planck 2018**, **SDSS DR17**, **Pantheon+** — all consistent with XTT time remapping
