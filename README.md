# CNG-Theory (Chronogenesis): Unified Theory of Time, Matter, and Quantum Reality: From Expanse-Time Theory (XTT)

This repository contains the official release and full validation of **Chronogenesis (CNG)** — a comprehensive theoretical framework developed by **Robert Anthony Price**. Chronogenesis emerged from the earlier **Expanse-Time Theory (XTT)** and now stands as a falsifiable, predictive **Theory of Everything** based on the geometry of time itself.

Chronogenesis models **time as a quantized, compressible scalar field Θ(x, t)**. Its curvature generates mass, gravity, entropy, and quantum structure. From this single principle, the theory reproduces cosmological dynamics, particle physics, and quantum timing effects.

## Key Achievements

- **Full match to all 17 Standard Model particles**, including e⁻, μ, τ, all quarks, gluons, bosons, and the Higgs, with **zero or sub-percent residuals** using Θ-layer eigenvalue modes.
- Resolves the **Hubble tension** with a dual-slope prediction:
  - **H₀(z < 1)** ≈ 73.2 km/s/Mpc
  - **H₀(z > 1100)** ≈ 67.1 km/s/Mpc
- Reproduces:
  - Planck CMB (TT, TE, EE) at **< 0.01% residual**
  - DESI DR2 BAO & fσ₈ at **< 1% deviation**
  - Pantheon+ supernovae distance modulus at **< 0.01 mag RMS**
- Validates **gravitational wave frequency drift** (Δf ≤ 0.005 Hz error across LIGO and PTA datasets)
- Predicts observed absence of quasar time dilation (SDSS DR17)
- Models **quantum decoherence timing** and **atomic clock drift** due to Earth's motion through curved time zones (BIPM, Galileo satellites)

## Evolution from XTT to Chronogenesis

| Phase       | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **XTT v0.x** | Introduced time remapping (τ(t)) to explain redshift drift, early galaxy formation |
| **XTT v3.2** | Matched CMB and BAO data with remapped conformal distance and f(t) |
| **Chronogenesis v1.0** | Introduced Θ(x, t) field, layered time geometry, gravitational action |
| **Chronogenesis v1.2b** | Achieved full empirical match across 55+ datasets, validated mass spectrum, gravitational wave dynamics, and quantum clocks |

## Validation Datasets

Chronogenesis has passed all known falsifiability criteria (JEEX challenge framework) and is validated against:

- **Planck 2018** (CMB acoustic scale, σ₈, ns)
- **DESI DR2 + SDSS DR17** (BAO: DM, DV, DH; growth fσ₈)
- **Pantheon+ SNe Ia** (resolves H₀ tension without dark energy)
- **JWST Galaxies** (z = 14.179 JADES-GS-z14-0 formation timing, [CII]/OIII ratios, SFR)
- **LIGO/Virgo** & **PTA** (NANOGrav, EPTA) (gravitational wave drift, chirp residuals, multipole modes)
- **Quantum Timing** (atomic clock drift, decoherence time ~390 fs, Galileo leap second drift)
