Expanse-Time Theory (XTT): Alternative Cosmology, Redshift Drift, and CMB-Validated Physics Expanse-Time Theory (XTT) 

By Robert Anthony Price

Expanse-Time Theory (XTT) is a new cosmological model that reinterprets redshift, time dilation, and the evolution of cosmic structures by allowing time itself — not just space — to expand. This theory removes the need for dark energy and inflation, while staying consistent with general relativity at local scales. 

Why It Matters 

XTT has been tested against data from JWST, DESI DR2, Planck, SDSS DR17, LIGO, and Pantheon+ SNe. All tests show sub-percent deviation from observation — often outperforming the standard Lambda-CDM model. 

Recent Validation Early galaxies like JADES-GS-z10-0 form naturally under XTT's expanded time framework. BAO and redshift drift tests from DESI align with XTT to within 1–3%. LIGO frequency drift predicted and observed in agreement with XTT predictions. Jet structures in 3C111 and radio shells like ORCs match predictions of time-surface geometry.

About the Author 

I'm a builder by trade — not a physicist, not a professor. I didn’t pass GCSE science. But I built this theory from scratch, testing it with the same data used by the world’s top researchers. This is proof that anyone can do real science — if they care enough to keep going.
