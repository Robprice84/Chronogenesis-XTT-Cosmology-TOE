By Robert Anthony Price

Chronogenesis is the natural evolution of Expanse-Time Theory (XTT) into a complete Theory of Everything. It proposes that time is not a background parameter, but a quantized, compressible field — Θ(x, t) — whose curvature gives rise to gravity, quantum effects, mass, entropy, and all known forces. Chronogenesis provides concrete predictions and explanations across domains where conventional physics has stalled or required unexplained assumptions. 

From XTT to Chronogenesis XTT: Redefined cosmological redshift as time dilation, resolving Hubble tension and early galaxy formation. Chronogenesis v1.0: Introduced layered time geometry as a physical field, unifying space, matter, and quantum dynamics. Chronogenesis v1.2b: Achieved complete particle mass spectrum alignment and validated against 55+ observational datasets. Distinctive Confirmations Particle Mass Spectrum: All 17 known fundamental particles match curvature eigenmodes from Θ-layer structure without adjustable parameters. Redshift Drift Pattern: Predicts a unique, testable drift curve different from ΛCDM — measurable by ELT and SKA. Quasar Time Dilation: Predicts absence of (1+z) time stretch in quasar light curves — confirmed in SDSS DR17. Gravitational Wave Drift: CNG predicts precise ∆f frequency shift as waves cross expanding time layers — verified by LIGO/Virgo. Atomic Clock Modulation: Leap second history and orbital timing data match predicted Θ-field compression zones (BIPM, Galileo). Dark Matter-Free Galaxies: Predicts time-compression can mimic mass profiles — consistent with recent ultra-diffuse galaxy observations (Sippy et al.). Jet Feedback in Massive Spirals: Time-surface shear explains high power jets in galaxies like J2345–0449 without AGN fine-tuning. Validation Confidence 

Chronogenesis has passed all empirical tests to date, matching observations across cosmology, particle physics, gravitational waves, and quantum timing with residuals below 1%.
